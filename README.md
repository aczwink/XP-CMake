"Cross platform cmake" is a set of cmake modules that allows to write compiler/OS/... independent scripts

Though cmake is a cross platform tool, the scripts written for it are mostly dependent on the build platform and quite likely fail on different platforms. These modules take over what actually should have been cmake's job in my opinion
